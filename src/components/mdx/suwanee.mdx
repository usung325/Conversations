export const body1 = `whereas my body remembers differently than his does
whereas we enter the same space carrying different histories: his shoulders square against expectations I never had to shoulder / my hips swaying with freedoms he never thought to claim

Here: in this warehouse district where trains once carried steel & coal & now carry nothing but echo—we attempt translation

Copy                his body
                                    my body
                                                        our bodies in conversation

In the first recording he moves with the assurance of someone who has never had to justify the space they occupy. Each gesture arrives fully formed fully owned fully expected`

export const body2 = `whereas their body flows like water through predetermined forms
whereas we enter the same studio carrying different gravities: their movements floating on years of practiced grace / my gestures anchored by street-learned survival

Here: in this mirrored room where dancers once pirouetted to Tchaikovsky & now spin to electronic beats—we attempt translation

Mirror              their body
                                    my body
                                                        our bodies in dialogue

To watch them dance is to witness transformation: the way technique shaped their bones / the way tradition taught them to fly / the way classical forms dissolved into something entirely their own

To dance their dance is to speak in borrowed arabesques. When I lift my leg as they do the air holds me differently. When I turn as they do the world spins at a different speed. This is not about skill this is about history this is about the archaeology of movement

Consider: two bodies tracing the same patterns through space but reading different maps
Consider: the mirror reflects us both without judgment

In the second recording they move with the precision of someone who has rewritten every rule they were taught. Each gesture arrives deconstructed reconstructed reclaimed`

export const body3 = `whereas my body navigates space with different tools
whereas we enter the same stage carrying different capabilities: their movements extending beyond my reach / my adaptations creating new choreographies they never imagined

Here: in this black box theater where dancers once leaped & now we redefine what dance can be—we attempt translation

Adapt               their body
                                    my body
                                                        our bodies in negotiation

To watch them dance is to witness assumption: the way society shaped their freedom / the way ability informed their choices / the way movement vocabularies were built without bodies like mine in mind

To dance their dance is to speak in translated gestures. When they reach high I extend differently. When they cross the floor I trace my own path. This is not limitation this is innovation this is the poetry of adaptation

Consider: two bodies interpreting the same score through different instruments
Consider: the stage holds space for all our ways of moving

In the third recording I move with the creativity of someone who has learned to compose their own language. Each gesture arrives reimagined redefined revolutionary`
